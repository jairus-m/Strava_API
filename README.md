# Strava_API

Data Analysis / ETL Project


This project has several goals:

1. Learn to utlize APIs via Strava's REST API in order to access over 5 years of my activity data. 

2. Get all my personal data and process it using Python and various libraries. 

3. Analyze my activity data. This data includes cycling, running, hiking, climbing, swimming, and other sports that I have logged since 2017. 

4. Create a reproducible script with functions.

5. Create a pipline to Tableau for analysis, visualization, and exploration from outside users. 
    The dashboard can be found here:

There is a final goal which is to utilize machine learning to predict energy power (watttage) output based on different features in the cycling data.
